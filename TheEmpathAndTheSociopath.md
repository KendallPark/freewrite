The cure is empathy, said Abel. One must feel for another as he feels for himself to the degree that it inhibits him from harming another. 

Abel stood over his brother, who was handcuffed to a medical bed. He continued: As a species we must take charge of our own natural selection. We need to positively select for empathy, and negatively select for a lack of feeling or remorse.

So you intend to kill those that don't meet your empathy cut-off? said Cain.

No, not necessarily. Sterilization is all that is required to insure that these traits are not passed on. Not to mention, thanks to a lifetime of research, a lack of empathy has become treatable like so many other psychological disorders. Those with strong enough dark triad traits will have a decision: sterilization and empathy treatment, or death.

You're the last person I'd expect to propose a final solution. Why not imprison those that you have marked for execution?

In the new society it will hurt the individual too much to see his neighbor's freedoms taken away.

A society such as the one you wish to create will be crippled, remarked Cain. Who will be able to make the tough calls? Wouldn't it cause a sufficiently empathetic individual great anxiety to decide who should live and who should die? And what of justice? Justice calls for extreme measures, at times.

Which is why there must be an arbiter. This man would perform the brutal tasks that society requires. This man would sacrifice his soul for the good of society.

It seems a burden too much for a man to bear. Recall how well it worked for Rashkolnikov.

Yes, said Abel. Only because Rashkolnikov drowned in his guilt. What I propose is to suppress the neurology responsible for guilt in this one person, the arbiter. 

And whom have you chosen to be your ubermensch? asked Cain.

I volunteer myself. I cannot with good conscience place this burden on anyone else. 

So you intend to become like me to save the world from people like me. Do you not see the irony in this, brother?

I thought about offering the job to you. But you've known nothing but yourself your entire life. I will at least remember times of empathy, and will be able to reason about what it is to feel for another's well being. You, on the other hand, have no stake in the well-being of those that provide no benefit to you.

My actions are aligned to the good of others these days. Even so, I don't think my God would permit me to meet out a justice which is his alone.

God! Abel laughed. I find your newfound piety fascinating. How long will those bars hold? How long this moral code keep your baser nature caged?

Until my death, Lord willing. 

Which might be soon, so perhaps you will have your wish.

Brother, I cannot recommend this course of action. You were given the purest hearts, and I would not squander this gift.

Abel applauded. Look at you! My dear Cain, expressing brotherly concern for once in his life! What does my fate matter to you? Or is this something your new dogma has taught you? Tell me, brother, if I died right now, would you feel anything?

I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. At the very least I might weep for my unfeeling soul.

But would you weep for me?

I don't know. Ten years ago, no, not a tear. But today? I pray that I would. I have prayed this every night.

Abel took out a syringe and dipped the needle in a vial of clear liquid. He drew half of the solution into the syringe. 

I've been working on this for years. It contains a cocktail of neurotransmitter inhibitors. It should block the necessary pathways involved with the sensation of guilt. Not an easy task, engineering molecules that inhibit only certain interactions of the same neurotransmitters. It was so fortunate that you and I share most of our DNA. It made the task of identifying the differences between our brain chemistries significantly easier.

Brother, please do not do this to yourself. 

Enough of your faux-concern. I know why you care. You know that as I soon as this medication takes effect, I will kill you.

I am more concerned for your soul than my own, but I know that nothing I say will convince you of this. 

Abel admired the syringe, holding it to the laboratory light. How does it feel, to care only about yourself?

Cain sighed. It's terribly lonely, being god.

I see in your old age you've sought companionship with like beings.

Not companionship. Servitude. It's the only chance I have of being freed from myself.

Abel rolled up his sleeve, took a deep breath, and plunged the needle into his arm.

You can't save her, you know.

It was never in my power. But it was in yours. She sought out a wolf for her savior and you devoured her. Like countless others that have suffered to feed your ego.

For that I am sorry, said Cain.

But are you? Can you honestly say that? Have you suffered at all for anything you've done? Or are you simply rationalizing that you ought be sorry, when in fact you feel nothing.

That rationalization is all that I can give you. It is all I can give anyone.

It is not enough.

But is it not functionally the same? Must I feel guilt to know that my actions are wrong? My heart might be hardened, but as long as there's a God, my mind can reason out the things which are against him.

The God that opens his gates to someone like you is no God at all. You must learn what it is like to suffer for the sake of someone other than yourself.

I see now, my dear Ivan. It is not that you want justice, it is that you want your justice *now*.

Abel stood up. Enough of this banter. I believe the medication has had its full effect, as the thought of killing you no longer disturbs me.

It doesn't have to be this way, said Abel. You can still decide your fate. Abel presented Cain with two vials. Both contained clear solutions. The one in my right hand contains a lethal poison, the one in my left holds a drug that makes one extremely empathetic. Pick your poison, so to speak. Will you not choose empathy, to save your own life?

Cain shifted his gaze from one vial to the other. Then he bowed his head and said, I choose to remain my wretched self.

So be it. Abel filled half a large syringe with the lethal drug. He held it up for Cain to see. You lose, brother.

You know, said Cain, I think--for the first time--I've actually won.

Abel grit his teeth. He opened his mouth as if to respond, then shut it. After a thoughtful moment, he dipped the needle into the other solution and filled the remainder of the syringe.

I figure, you should at least know what you're missing out on, before you die.

Cain felt a prick in his arm. Within a minute, he was weeping bitterly. Within five minutes, he was dead.
