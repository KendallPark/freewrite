She would sometimes imagine them skydiving together. Her parachute would fail, and he would swim to her through the clouds, and they would fall, together, arms wrapped tightly in that rushing wind, racing to greet the hard earth.

She wondered what kind of deep truths would be communicated between their eyes during that doomed, weightless minute. He would know. He would know then.

Presently he was peeling an orange on the other side of the cafeteria table. He glanced up. Their gaze clicked for a second, but then his attention returned to the orange peel. Years of friendship had ground down the conversation topics. This was not a bad thing. They often spent the evenings in his dorm room, working on homework to the throb of dubstep or Mozart or The Eli Young Band. 

Sometimes she would wake up in night to find him basking in dim glow of his laptop, having stolen away into her room, which she always kept unlocked for that exact reason. It's quieter on the girls' floors, he would say. She would wish him goodnight and let the tap-tap-tap of his keyboard bleed into her dreams. 

He was always gone when she woke up the next morning.

It was senior year and the last bits of her patience were being scraped away. They had had THAT conversation sophomore year. She spent the rest of her college years waiting. To her the answer was clear, like a long and tiresome math problem that nonetheless arrived at the same conclusion. But he lived with his nose stuck in the present only concerned himself with the equations due the following morning.

I don't like choosing a path until I have sufficient facts, he would say. About everything.

He had no plans for after graduation. Only a vague declaration of grad school. But it was their last semester and he had yet to touch an application. She had already jumped through those hoops and secured her first salaried job--a research position at one the California universities.

Do you not feel this? she would wonder at him. The sense of urgency. The cadence of life was picking up, an accelerating beat that would soon thrust them into their separate futures. 

Tick-tick-tick, she muttered to herself.

Did you say something? he asked. They were walking to convenience store. At that moment the railroad crossing warning lights started blinking. She instinctively sprinted forward, across the tracks, ducking under the the crossing levers as they closed off the road. A train horn blared in the east. 

He was not with her. She turned backed to find him on the opposite side of the tracks, cut off by the railroad guards. The train could be seen in the distance. He still had ample time to maneuver around the bars that were meant to obstruct cars, not humans. But there was a $250 fine for crossing while the guards were down. There were no police cars nearby, but she knew he wouldn't risk this.

They laughed at the predicament from their respective sides of the tracks. He mouthed words but they were drowned by the thunder of the approaching train. Then he had disappeared from her view, the train cars roaring and screeching between them. Electric sparks shot from the steel wheels. 

A wave of emotion swelled in her chest. Grief? No, no, she shook her head.

Pity.
