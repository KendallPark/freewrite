He was the smartest person he knew. 

Some people thought it was arrogant for him to think so, but when asked whom they thought was smarter, they struggled to find a name.

He lived in his own mind. Hours, each day, held captive by his thoughts. 

He was never lonely though. He had good friends and was a good friend. 

He never thought himself a genius either. He had met a lot of smart people that thought themselves geniuses. They were not as smart as him. Some scored higher on their standardized tests, some got better grades, it was true. But most of their thinking was very rigid. These so-called geniuses could assimilate knowledge and concepts quickly. But they remained locked upon the tracks of conventional thought. 

Lateral thinking. That was his forte. In fifth grade he had won the "Thinking Outside the Box" award. Many scholarships and prestigious recognitions later, it still remained his most prized award.

He had a high propensity for novel thought. It started with an itch. Two pieces of knowledge would surface in his mind, seemingly unrelated.

But that liaison remained obscured from his conscious mind--only the nagging feeling, an instinct, convinced him that there was in fact, something there.

But given how many professors and colleagues had remarked to him, "I never thought of it that way," he was fairly confident that his unique neurology was not merely his own perception. 

He had a disdain for authority, which perhaps contributed to his ability to question the assumptions that so many took for granted. 



He was afraid to touch her, not because he thought her fragile, but rather because he did not want to taint her exotic soul with his own. It seemed criminal to attempt to domesticate such a rare creature. 

She was an alien. He first suspected this when he first saw her gazing at the night sky. Such intensity lurked in those eyes as they wandered in bittersweet longing. He knew that she was hopelessly trapped on this planet. He wanted that moment to build her a shuttle to return her to place upon the stars. 

As a visitor to Earth, she regarded the things of his world with strong curiosity. She could spent
