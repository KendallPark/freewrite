When did he stop caring?

He wondered this. It was one of the few things he wondered these days. In a period of less than a year he watched the things he wanted most slip away like inconsequential facts from memory. And he didn't care. He found his apathy toward his loss more disturbing than his actual loss. But that didn't bother him.

Caring is an evolutionarily advantageous trait, he thought. Individuals that care about the things of life tend to live and pass on their caring genes. Individuals that don't care don't.

He marveled at the agency that spurned him to sneak out of his parents' house this night. It was a gravel road on which he tread; the pulse of crickets and grinding of his footsteps were the only sounds accompanying him on this lonely promenade. Iowa plains stretched like a taut sheet from the corners of the horizon. A billion unreachable stars loomed overhead in the autumn sky, glittering like the ring that another had given her. Scorpio had started its descent to the southern hemisphere. Scorpio had been his favorite constellation.

He wished that someone would absolve him of the responsibility of existence, to quarantine him so that he could have no effect on the world, and the world none on him. He knew this was a physical impossibility: even as an observer he helped shape reality. Without observations, everything boiled down to nebulous probability. A particle might be here or it might there, remaining simultaneously in state of both and neither until observed. It seemed that everything floated around in probability clouds until he focused on them, then they would fixate, and never in his favor.

His mother was in the kitchen when he finally crept through the back door. She tended to bake things when she couldn't sleep. She gave her son a tired smile and offered him a cinnamon roll.

He thanked her and took a bite. She looked at her son eagerly, waiting for his appraisal. He gave none. It was food and it tasted like food.
